Traffic System implemented for Softeware Testing.   
The stereotype of system is built by Time Miller.   
And some adjustments and changes are made to conduct experiments.   

There are two main methods in the project.    
One is in the class "IntersectionDriverSerialMarkovModel", which is responsible for generating the transition matrix and experimental results of serial-structured traffic light system;   
To run this file, type ant following with the file name.

The other one is in the class "IntersectionDriverParallelMarkovModel", which is responsible for 
generating the transition matrix and experimental results of parallel-structured traffic light system;    
To run this file, type ant following with the file name.
